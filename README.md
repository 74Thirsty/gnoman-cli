✨ **What is GNOMAN?**

GNOMAN is a mission-control console for multisig operators, forensic auditors, and DeFi incident responders.
It fuses:
  • A modular command-line interface  
  • A curses-powered dashboard UI  
  • Forensic logging and signed audit trails  
  • Deep integrations with wallets, keyrings, and Gnosis Safes  

GNOMAN replaces a zoo of fragile scripts with a single god-tier control deck.

# 🚀 **Core Features**

🔑 **Secrets & Wallets**
  • Full keyring integration (freedesktop-secrets, macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Locker).  
  • .env / .env.secure drift detection and reconciliation.  
  • HD wallet support with:  
    • Hidden derivation trees  
    • Custom derivation paths  
    • Vanity address generation  
    • Cold wallet / hot executor separation.  
  • Wallet monitoring with real-time balance and nonce tracking.

🏛️ **Safe Orchestration**
  • Deploy new Gnosis Safes with arbitrary owner sets & thresholds.  
  • Add/remove owners, rotate keys, and patch Safe configs live.  
  • Automatic Safe ABI syncing (via ABISchemaManager).  
  • Submit, batch, and simulate transactions across multiple Safes.

🧰 **Contract Toolkit**
  • ABI loading, schema enforcement, and method resolution.  
  • Transaction builder with type-safe argument validation.  
  • Ephemeral executors for flash execution (EIP-6780 friendly).  
  • Gas calibration and automatic fee bumpers.

📊 **Forensic Audit Mode**
  • Crawl wallets, Safes, and secrets into a signed report (JSON/PDF).  
  • Includes:  
    • Wallet balance snapshots  
    • Safe threshold configs  
    • Expiring secrets  
    • Last access timestamps  
  • Reports cryptographically signed with GNOMAN’s audit key.

🧠 **Arbitrage & DeFi Hooks**
  • Plugin loader for loan and trade modules (Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, Aave, etc.).  
  • Canonical schema enforcement for graph + execution steps.  
  • RPZE pathfinding validator integration.  
  • ExecutionManager hooks for cycle watching, memory attach, and readiness checks.

📡 **Sync & Drift Detection**
  • gnoman sync: reconcile secrets across keyring, .env, .env.secure, and remote vaults.  
  • Detect drift and resolve conflicts interactively.

📟 **Dashboard UI**
  • Curses-powered neon cockpit.  
  • Views: diffs, branches, GitHub status, Safe states, audit logs.  
  • Keyboard-driven interactive ops (submit tx, rotate key, reconcile secrets).

# 🔧 **Installation**

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install gnoman-cli
````

From DockerHub:

```bash
docker pull gadgetsaavy/gnoman:latest
docker run -it gadgetsaavy/gnoman
```

From Source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/74Thirsty/gnoman-cli.git
cd gnoman-cli
pip install -e .
```

# 🕹️ **Usage**

CLI:

```bash
gnoman safe deploy --owners 0xA.. 0xB.. 0xC.. --threshold 2
gnoman wallet derive --path "m/44'/60'/0'/0/1337"
gnoman sync
gnoman audit --output report.pdf
```

Dashboard:

```bash
gnoman tui
```

Navigate with arrow keys. q to quit.

🔒 **Security Posture**
• All secrets loaded from keyring-first (never plaintext by default).
• Forensic logs signed with GNOMAN’s audit key.
• Ephemeral execution to prevent key leakage.
• Multisig-first design: never trust a single key.

⸻

🛠️ **Roadmap**
• Remote vault sync (Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
• ML-based anomaly detection in audit mode.
• zk-proof attestation of audit reports.
• Direct Flashbots bundle submission from dashboard.
